# -------------------------------------------// (2) DESIGNER //----------------------------------
#
# DESIGNER is the core engine for creating all the primer and probe candidates and computing all the
# thermodynamic aspects of design such as target unimolecular folding, primer folding, bimolecular
# hybridization, and solving the multi-state coupled equilibria for the amount bound for the desired bimolecular
# duplex. The amount bound is directly related to the amount of signal generated in a diagnostic assay.
#
# DESIGNER also analyzes each primer and probe design for a series of heuristic properties such as
# sequence complexity, polyG test, oligo length penalty, amplicon length penalty, etc. Each of the scoring effects
# are multiplied by weighting factors and combined into an overall score for each primer/ probe set.
#
# In December 2018 functionality was added to PanelPlex is support for dbSNP (for human genome
# version GRCh38 and mouse genome version mm10). PanelPlex automatically detects all the positions with
# alternative alleles with CAF > 0.01 within each of the design regions and then automatically designs the
# primers to AVOID those SNP sites.
#
# 1. Generate potential solutions Generate k-mers as initial solutions
# 2. Score each solutions TODO define scoring algorithm, including SNP penalty
# 3. Select top candidates for each target (init_solutions)
# 4. BLAST against amplicons in panel and discard matches TODO implement BLAST search
# 5. Keep top N solutions (top_solutions_to_keep)
# 6. Perform multiplex picking in N^X space for N solutions and X targets TODO implement multiplex picker algorithm
